This is a practice CSS project on The Odin Project. The goal in building this webpage is to practice my CSS and HTML skills by recreating a website from scratch. The actual look of the website is provided by The Odin Project.

The cartoon images were created by my fiancee, Sorcha McGlinchey, and can be found on her website sorchacartoons.com, as well as her instagram @SorchaCartoons.
